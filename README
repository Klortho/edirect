Entrez Direct (EDirect) is a new method for accessing the NCBI's interconnected Entrez databases (including PubMed and GenBank). It lets a researcher perform sophisticated multi-step queries without requiring any programming. EDirect constructs an Entrez search from commands typed into a terminal window, using command-line arguments for query terms and combining individual operations with UNIX pipes. It also provides a convenient method for extracting data from document summaries or other results that are returned in XML format.

Documentation is provided in doc/ and pdf/ subdirectories within the software archive. The INTRO file presents each command separately. The executive SUMMARY is an advanced introduction using a typical research question. XTRACT is an E-ticket ride on the XML data extractor. And the user GUIDE contains the most detailed and comprehensive documentation of EDirect.

Once the archive is extracted, you can immediately try EDirect by copying the sample query below into the clipboard and pasting it into a terminal window. (If necessary, run PATH=$PATH:$HOME/edirect at the start of the terminal session to temporarily add the EDirect functions to the PATH environment variable so they can be executed by name.)

  esearch -db pubmed -query "Beadle AND Tatum and Neurospora" | \
  elink -related | \
  efilter -query "NOT historical article [FILT]" | \
  esummary | \
  xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -match "<Author>" -and "<Title>" \
    -element Id -first "Author/Name" -element PubDate Title | \
  grep -i -e enzyme -e synthesis | \
  sort -t $'\t' -k 2,2f -k 4,4f | column -s $'\t' -t | cut -c 1-128

Entrez Direct will be released as a supported NCBI product in the near future.
